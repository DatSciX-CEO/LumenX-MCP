# Roadmap - Legal Spend MCP Server

This document outlines the future plans and development roadmap for the Legal Spend MCP Server.

## Vision

To become the leading open-source Model Context Protocol server for enterprise legal spend intelligence, enabling seamless integration with AI agents and providing actionable insights from diverse legal financial data.

## Current Status

The project currently provides core functionality for multi-source data integration (APIs, databases, files) and foundational analytics for legal spend.

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

Below is a high-level overview of planned features and improvements. This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, technological advancements, and resource availability.

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements & Stability (Current - Next 3-6 Months)

-   [ ] **Improved Data Source Connectors**:
    -   [ ] Enhanced error handling and resilience for all data source integrations.
    -   [ ] Support for additional database types (e.g., SQLite for local development/testing).
    -   [ ] More robust handling of large CSV/Excel files.
-   [ ] **Performance Optimizations**:
    -   [ ] Investigate and implement performance improvements for large datasets.
    -   [ ] Optimize data loading and processing routines.
-   [ ] **Expanded Analytics & Reporting**:
    -   [ ] Time-series analysis for spend trends (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year comparisons).
    -   [ ] Customizable reporting templates.
-   [ ] **User & Role Management (Basic)**:
    -   [ ] Initial implementation of basic user authentication (e.g., API key management).
    -   [ ] Simple role-based access control for tools/resources.

### Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence & Scalability (Next 6-12 Months)

-   [ ] **Machine Learning-based Spend Predictions**:
    -   [ ] Implement models for forecasting future legal spend.
    -   [ ] Anomaly detection to flag unusual spending patterns.
-   [ ] **Enhanced Benchmark Analytics**:
    -   [ ] Integration with external legal industry benchmark data (if available and permissible).
    -   [ ] More sophisticated peer comparison metrics for vendors.
-   [ ] **GraphQL API Support**:
    -   [ ] Introduce a GraphQL endpoint for more flexible data querying by clients.
-   [ ] **Real-time Notifications**:
    -   [ ] Webhook or push notification support for spend alerts (e.g., budget overruns).
-   [ ] **Container Orchestration Support**:
    -   [ ] Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
    -   [ ] Docker Compose enhancements for production environments.

### Phase 3: Ecosystem & Community Growth (Long-term)

-   [ ] **Plugin Architecture**:
    -   [ ] Allow community-contributed data source connectors and analytics modules.
-   [ ] **Web-based UI (Optional)**:
    -   [ ] Develop a basic web interface for server management and data visualization.
-   [ ] **Broader MCP Client Compatibility**:
    -   [ ] Ensure seamless integration with a wider range of MCP-compliant clients.
